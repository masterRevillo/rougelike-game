Rev's First Rouge-Like Game
===

This project is my rendition of the rouge-like tutorial found on http://rogueliketutorials.com/.

###Running
To run the game, you must have Python 3.6 or higher. Depending on your Python setup (let's face it, everyone's is
different, even if you follow the exact same guide), you should be able to run the following command to install the
require Python dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

I say that, but I actually had to run this command to install them:

```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

Again, Python versions. Whatever.

In any case, once you install the requirements, you should be able to start the game by running:

```python3 main.py```

That's it!
